[KDD '25 Applied Data Science Track] FoRAGe: High-CTR Food Image Synthesis with Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Model

<details>
<summary>[Abstract]</summary>
The demonstrable commercial value of high Click-Through Rates (CTR) imagery for food delivery platforms necessitates strategies for visually compelling image generation. Our investigations reveal a positive correlation between appropriately chosen backgrounds in food images and subsequent user engagement, yet a dedicated methodology for high-CTR food image synthesis remains absent. In this paper, we propose **FoRAGe**, a novel high-CTR **Fo**od **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **Ge**neration pipeline leveraging ControlNet based on Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive food image database encompassing a diverse range of background environments. During image generation, FoRAGe retrieves high-quality background exemplars featuring analogous food subjects from the database and employs the retrieved backgrounds as conditions to guide image synthesis via the ControlNet model. Subsequently, a multimodal CTR prediction model is utilized to identify and select optimal images for deployment. Online A/B testing results demonstrate a statistically significant increase in CTR for images generated by our proposed pipeline, and ablation studies further elucidate the impact of different strategies and configurations.
